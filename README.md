# Discrete Mathematics and Alghortims

This is a Java assignment on Discrete Mathematics. The assignment consists of several functions that have been implemented in Java.

The following functions have been implemented:

* GCD - This function calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two given numbers.

* decToBinary - This function converts a decimal number to its binary equivalent.

* extendedEA - This function calculates the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) for two given numbers.

* findMax - This function finds the maximum number in a given array.

* findMax2 - This function finds the second maximum number in a given array.

* squareMultiply - This function implements the Square and Multiply algorithm.

All the functions have been implemented and tested. The code has been uploaded to the repository and is available for review.

To run the code, simply compile and execute the respective Java file for each function.

Thank you.
